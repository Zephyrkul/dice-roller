Rolls dice. Experiementing on JQuery and random number theory
This site is publicly available [here (Clicky)](https://zephyrkul.github.io/dice-roller/).  
Note that there is a small mechanic that isn't well-documented: If you click on the die to the left of the text box, it'll turn into a spade. This means the dice can **ace**, which means that, if it rolls its highest value, it is rolled again and added. If you end up with a die roll higher than the number of faces on the die, click the spade and it'll change back.
